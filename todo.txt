Can the file be correctly imported by localc (Libre Office Spreadsheet
application)?

Some entries in database/cross_word_database.tsv have spaces as separators instead of tabs. Fix this later.

Before committing the file
  1. make sure that all lines have at least one tab. To check this, run
    grep -vP "\t" database/cross_word_database.tsv
  there should not be any output.
  2. there are no duplicate lines
Is it possible to do this automatically?
