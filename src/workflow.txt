Add entries to database/cross_word_database.tsv . You can add them anywhere as
they will be sorted later on.

We use tabs to distinguish between the fields. Make sure that the editor does
not expand tabs into spaces. In vim, this is done by setting :set noexpandtab.

Sort the database
 src/sort_cw_data.sh database/cross_word_database.tsv

review the changes and commit.
